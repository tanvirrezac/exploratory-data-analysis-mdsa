# Exploratory Data Analysis – Real-World Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using a real-world dataset. The goal is to understand the structure, quality, and patterns in the data and translate findings into meaningful insights.

## Objective
To explore, clean, and analyze the dataset in order to identify key trends, relationships, and potential issues that could inform further modeling or decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains real-world observations relevant to analytical exploration. Basic preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Learnings
- Structuring an analytical workflow
- Identifying data quality issues early
- Communicating insights through visualizations

## Project Context
This project was completed as part of the **Master of Data Science & Analytics (MDSA)** program.
